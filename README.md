# Tonight's Dinner ![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-passing-brightgreen)

## My Approach
Created a web-app that allows me to input, store and search the dinners I cook in the evening. Helpful for tracking what I eat and what I can make. Contains CRUD elements working successfully to add dinner, edit posting and delete food. 

Also contains a "I'm Feeling Hungry" feature, where when clicked, runs a function that randomly displays a dinner from the database, if the user is unsure what to eat.

Inspired by the [r/tonightsdinner](https://www.reddit.com/r/tonightsdinner/) subreddit on Reddit and my passion for food.
