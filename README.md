# Tonight's Dinner

## My Approach
Created a web-app that allows me to input and store the dinners I cook in the evening. Helpful for tracking what I eat and what I can make. Contains CRUD elements working successfully to add dinner, edit posting and delete food. Also contains a "I'm Feeling Hungry" feature, where when clicked, runs a function that randomly displays a dinner from the database, if the user is unsure what to eat.
