# Tonight's Dinner

Created a web-app that allows me to input and store the dinners I cook in the evening. Helpful for tracking what I eat and what I can make.

07/10/21 - MVP Nearly achieved, need to make the edit action work correctly.

09/10/21 - MVP achieved; add, delete, edit and read functions working correctly. Next stage is to add some more features and CSS styling.
